This file describes how to build and run Tokyo-jogging.

---------------------------------------------------
 What you need to build
---------------------------------------------------


1. Wiimote
---------------------- 
You've already had this one, haven't you?


2. Bluetooth stack
---------------------
You need a Blue stack to run Tokyo-jogging.

On Mac OSX, You'll have no problems. 
You can use a default Bluetooth stack. 

But on Windows, you MUST obtain a separate Bluetooth stack. 
Theoretically, BlueSoleil(*) should work, 
but it will be better with WIDOMM(**) for most people.

I developed and built Tokyo-jogging on Mac OSX, 
so I don't know much about how to build on Windows.
If you succeeded to build it, let me know it, please. 

(*) BlueSoleil http://www.bluesoleil.com/download/
(**) WIDOMM http://www.broadcom.com/products/bluetooth_update.php


3. JDK
---------------------
You need JDK(*) 1.5 or higher version to build and run Tokyo-jogging.

On Mac OSX, you can use default JDK.
On Windows, you need to install and add the Java executable 
to your Command Prompt path.

4. Eclipse
---------------------
You can run Tokyo-jogging without using Eclipse(*).
But it's very useful for building and running it and I recommend it.
Eclipse is a very handy (and free!) IDE that has a special place 
in the hearts of many Java programmers.

 How to build
---------------------------------------------------

1. Unzip the archive file.

2. Open Eclipse and select "New > Java Project" from the File menu.
   "Project name" is a free name, for example,"MyTokyoJogging".
3. Click "Finish" button.

4. Copy the src and lib directory in unzipped directory 
   and paste to your project(it may named "MyTokyoJogging") at Package Explorer.

5. Right-click on your package root directory and select "Propertied".

6. Select "Java Build Path".

7. Click the Libraries tab. Add in all JAR files in "lib" directory by clicking on Add External JARs.
   And after that Eclipse will re-build your project automatically.




---------------------------------------------------
 How to run
---------------------------------------------------

1. You need to make your PC/Mac to find your wiimote.
   
   On Mac OSX, RVL Enabler(*) is very useful for this operation.
   Just press Search in the Device Discovery window and it will find and pair 
   any Wiimotes that are discoverable.
   (On Windows, I don't know about any software like this..., sorry.)

2. On Eclipse, right-click on your package root directory and select "Run As > Java Application".

3. Select "TokyoJogging - tv.katsuma.jog" and click "OK" button.
   And it will run the program.

4. Open your web browser and go to "http://www.tokyo-jogging.com/start/".

5. Press the "SYNC" button on your back of Wiimote.
   If Tokyo-Jogging finds your Wiimote, the message will be displayed on Eclipse console.

6. Put your Wiimote to your pocket and clean up around you.

7 . Have fun! :-)
